What does it do?
----------------

This package provides deploy task for deploying TYPO3 CMS with deployer (deployer.org).

This "deploy" task depends on:

- `sourcebroker/deployer-extended`_ package which provides some deployer tasks that can be used for any CMS

Additionally this package depends on two more packages that are not used directly for deploy but are useful
for database and media synchronization:

- `sourcebroker/deployer-extended-database`_ package which provides some php framework independent tasks
  to synchronize database

- `sourcebroker/deployer-extended-media`_  package which provides some php framework independent tasks
  to synchronize media


Installation
------------

1) Install package with composer:
   ::

      composer require sourcebroker/deployer-extended-typo3

   Note! This command will install also deployer/dist package which will create ./vendor/bin/dep binary. You should use
   this binary to run deploy. Its advisable that you put `alias dep="php ./vendor/bin/dep"` in your ~/.profile
   to be able to run deployer with regular "dep" command.

2) If you are using deployer as composer package then just put following line in your deploy.php:
   ::

      new \SourceBroker\DeployerExtendedTypo3\Loader();

3) If you are using deployer as phar then put following lines in your deploy.php:
   ::

      require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/sourcebroker/deployer-loader/autoload.php');
      new \SourceBroker\DeployerExtendedTypo3\Loader();

4) Remove task "deploy" from your deploy.php. Otherwise you will overwrite deploy task defined in
   deployer/deploy/task/deploy.php


Deployment
----------

Its very advisable that you test deploy on some beta instance first :)
::

   dep deploy beta


The deploy task consist of following subtasks:
::

   task('deploy', [

   ])->desc('Deploy your TYPO3 9');

The shared dirs for TYPO3 9 are:
::

   set('shared_dirs', [
           'fileadmin',
           'uploads',
           'typo3temp/assets/_processed_',
           'typo3temp/assets/images',
           'typo3temp/var/logs',
       ]
   );

The shared files for TYPO3 9 are:
::

   set('shared_files', ['.env']);


Synchronizing database
----------------------

Database synchronization is done with `sourcebroker/deployer-extended-database`.

Read https://github.com/helhum/dotenv-connector to know how to reuse database data stored in .env file later in TYPO3.
This way you are able to store database credentials in one place.


Database configuration for TYPO3 9:
::

   set('db_default', [
       'truncate_tables' => [
           // Do not truncate caching tables "cf_cache_imagesizes" and "cf_cache_pages_tags" as the image settings are not
           // changed frequently and regenerating images is processor core extensive.
           '(?!cf_cache_imagesizes)cf_.*',
           'cache_.*'
       ],
       // Do not get those tables when synchronising database between instances as they can be very huge and usually are not needed.
       'ignore_tables_out' => [
           'cf_.*',
           'cache_.*',
           'be_sessions',
           'fe_sessions',
           'fe_session_data',
           'sys_file_processedfile',
           'sys_history',
           'sys_log',
           'sys_refindex',
           'tx_devlog',
           'tx_extensionmanager_domain_model_extension',
           'tx_powermail_domain_model_mail*',
           'tx_powermail_domain_model_answer*',
           'tx_solr_.*',
           'tx_crawler_queue',
           'tx_crawler_process',
       ],
       'post_sql_in' => '',
       'post_sql_in_markers' => ''
   ]);

   set('db_databases',
       [
           'database_default' => [
               get('db_default'),
               (new \SourceBroker\DeployerExtendedTypo3\Drivers\Typo3EnvDriver)->getDatabaseConfig(
                   [
                       'host' => 'TYPO3__DB__Connections__Default__host',
                       'port' => 'TYPO3__DB__Connections__Default__port',
                       'dbname' => 'TYPO3__DB__Connections__Default__dbname',
                       'user' => 'TYPO3__DB__Connections__Default__user',
                       'password' => 'TYPO3__DB__Connections__Default__password',
                   ]
               ),
           ]
       ]
   );

The command for synchronizing database from live media to local instance is:
::

   dep db:pull live



Synchronizing media
-------------------

Media synchronization is done with `sourcebroker/deployer-extended-media`.
Folders which are synchronized are ``fileadmin`` (except ``_proccessed_``) and ``uploads``.
The config for that is:
::

   set('media',
       [
           'filter' => [
               '+ /fileadmin/',
               '- /fileadmin/_processed_/*',
               '+ /fileadmin/**',
               '+ /uploads/',
               '+ /uploads/**',
               '- *'
           ]
       ]);

The command for synchronizing local media folders with live media folders is:
::

   dep media:pull live
